Basically Sass (indented CSS)
and Scss (sassy CSS)
are different.
In Scss, it's extension of css i.e, every valid css can be scss file.
In Sass, we indent instead of brackets for selectors and we put styles in New line instead of semicolon.
we use .scss and .sass file extensions for scss and sass respectively.
